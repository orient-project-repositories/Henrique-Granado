This folder contains the two environments used for training.
They are essentially the same, CythonOpenLoopNoiseless.py is more updated and makes use of the system built with Cython to speed up simulations.
OpenLoopNoiseless.py is commented, CythonOpenLoopNoiseless.py is only commented on the extra features.

NOTE: Don't forget to build the extensions on Core_Cython to make use of the this CythonOpenLoopNoiseless.py file.
